                  Good sources of vitamin B6
                  Vitamin B6 is found in a wide variety of foods, including: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>pork</li>
                    <li>poultry such as chicken or turkey</li>

                  </ul>
                  <h4>How much vitamin B6 do I need?</h4>
                  <p>
                  The amount of vitamin B6 adults (19-64 years) need is about:

                  1.4mg a day for men
                  1.2mg a day for women
                  You should be able to get all the vitamin B6 you need from your daily diet.
                  </p>
                  <h4>What happens if I take too much vitamin B6?</h4>
                  <p>
                  When taking a supplement, it's important not to take too much. Taking more than 200mg a day of vitamin B6 for a long time can lead to a loss of feeling in the arms and legs known as peripheral neuropathy.

                  This will usually improve once you stop taking the supplements. But in a few cases when people have taken large amounts of vitamin B6 – particularly for more than a few months – the effect can be permanent.

                  Taking doses of 10-200mg a day for short periods may not cause any harm. But there's not enough evidence to say how long these doses could be taken for safely.
                  </p>
                  <h4>What does the Department of Health advise?</h4>
                  <p>
                  You should be able to get the vitamin B6 you need by eating a varied and balanced diet. If you take vitamin B6 supplements, don't take too much as this could be harmful.

                  Don't take more than 10mg of vitamin B6 a day in supplements unless advised to by a doctor.

                Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, has several important functions.

                These include:

                helping to protect cells and keeps them healthy
                maintaining healthy skin, blood vessels, bones and cartilage
                helping with wound healing
                Lack of vitamin C can lead to scurvy. Mild deficiencies may occur in infants given unsupplemented cows' milk and in people with poor or very restricted diets.
                <p>
                <h4>Good sources of vitamin C</h4>
                <p>
                Vitamin C is found in a wide variety of fruit and vegetables. Good sources include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>oranges and orange juice</li>

                <li>potatoes</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>How much vitamin C do I need?</h4>
                <p>
                Adults (19-64 years) need 40mg of vitamin C a day.

                You should be able to get all the vitamin C you need from your daily diet.

                Vitamin C can't be stored in the body, so you need it in your diet every day.
                </p>
                <h4>
                What happens if I take too much vitamin C?
                </h4>
                <p>
                Taking large amounts (more than 1,000mg per day) of vitamin C can cause:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    stomach pain
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    diarrhoea
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    flatulence
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                These symptoms should disappear once you stop taking vitamin C supplements.
              </p>
              <h4>
                What does the Department of Health advise?
              </h4>
              <p>
                You should be able to get all the vitamin C you need by eating a varied and balanced diet. If you take vitamin C supplements, don't take too much as this could be harmful.

                Taking less than 1,000mg of vitamin C supplements a day is unlikely to cause any harm.

                  Vitamin D helps regulate the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body.

                  These nutrients are needed to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy.

                  A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone deformities such as rickets in children, and bone pain caused by a condition called osteomalacia in adults.
                </p>
                <h4>Good sources of vitamin D</h4>
                <p>
                From about late March/early April to the end of September, most people should be able to get all the vitamin D they need from sunlight. The body creates vitamin D from direct sunlight on the skin when outdoors.

                But between October and early March we don't get enough vitamin D from sunlight. Read more about vitamin D and sunlight.

                Vitamin D is also found in a small number of foods.

                Sources include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>oily fish – such as salmon, sardines, herring, mackerel and fresh tuna</li>
                <li>red meat</li>
                <li>liver</li>
                <li>egg yolks</li>
                <li>fortified foods – such as most fat spreads and some breakfast cereals</li>
                <li>Another source of vitamin D is dietary supplements.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                In the UK, cows' milk is generally not a good source of vitamin D because it isn't fortified, as it is in some other countries.
              </p>
                <h4>How much vitamin D do I need?</h4>
                <p>
                Babies up to the age of one year need 8.5-10mcg of vitamin D a day.

                Children from the age of one year and adults need 10mcg of vitamin D a day. This includes pregnant and breastfeeding women, and people at risk of vitamin D deficiency.

                From about late March/early April to the end of September, the majority of people should be able to get all the vitamin D they need from sunlight on their skin.

              </h6>
              <p>
                The Department of Health recommends that:

                breastfed babies from birth to one year of age should be given a daily supplement containing 8.5-10mcg of vitamin D to make sure they get enough
                formula-fed babies shouldn't be given a vitamin D supplement until they're having less than 500ml (about a pint) of infant formula a day, as infant formula is fortified with vitamin D
                children aged 1-4 years old should be given a daily supplement containing 10mcg of vitamin D
                You can buy vitamin D supplements or vitamin drops containing vitamin D (for under fives) at most pharmacies and supermarkets.

                Women and children who qualify for the Healthy Start scheme can get free supplements containing the recommended amounts of vitamin D. See the Healthy Start website for more information.

                Advice for adults and children over 5 years old
              </h6>
              <p>
                During the autumn and winter, you need to get vitamin D from your diet because the sun isn't strong enough for the body to make vitamin D.

                But since it's difficult for people to get enough vitamin D from food alone, everyone (including pregnant and breastfeeding women) should consider taking a daily supplement containing 10mcg of vitamin D during the autumn and winter.

                Between late March/early April to the end of September, most people can get all the vitamin D they need through sunlight on their skin and from a balanced diet. You may choose not to take a vitamin D supplement during these months.

                People at risk of vitamin D deficiency
              </h6>
              <p>
                Some people won't get enough vitamin D from sunlight because they have very little or no sunshine exposure.

                The Department of Health recommends that you take a daily supplement containing 10mcg of vitamin D throughout the year if you:

                aren't often outdoors – for example, if you're frail or housebound
                are in an institution like a care home
                usually wear clothes that cover up most of your skin when outdoors
                People with dark skin from African, African-Caribbean and south Asian backgrounds may also not get enough vitamin D from sunlight. They should consider taking a daily supplement containing 10mcg of vitamin D throughout the year.
              </p>
              <h6>
                What happens if I take too much vitamin D?
              </h6>
              <p>
                Taking too many vitamin D supplements over a long period of time can cause too much calcium to build up in the body (hypercalcaemia). This can weaken the bones and damage the kidneys and the heart.

                If you choose to take vitamin D supplements, 10mcg a day will be enough for most people.

                Don't take more than 100mcg of vitamin D a day as it could be harmful. This applies to adults, including pregnant and breastfeeding women and the elderly, and children aged 11-17 years.

                Children aged 1-10 years shouldn't have more than 50mcg a day. Infants under 12 months shouldn't have more than 25mcg a day.

                Some people have medical conditions that mean they may not be able to safely take as much. If in doubt, you should consult your doctor.

                If your doctor has recommended you take a different amount of vitamin D, you should follow their advice.

                Your body doesn't make too much vitamin D from sun exposure, but always remember to cover up or protect your skin if you're out in the sun for long periods to reduce the risk of skin damage and skin cancer.

                  Folic acid, known as folate in its natural form, helps:

                  the body form healthy red blood cells
                  reduce the risk of central neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, in unborn babies
                  A lack of folic acid could lead to folate deficiency anaemia.

                  Good sources of folic acid
                  Folate is found in small amounts in many foods.

                  Good sources include:

                <h4>
                  How much folic acid do I need?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Adults need 200mcg of folic acid a day. It can't be stored in the body, so you need it in your diet every day.

                  Most people should be able to get the amount they need by eating a varied and balanced diet.

                  But if you're pregnant or trying for a baby, it's recommended that you take 400mcg folic acid supplement daily from the time you stop using contraception until you're 12 weeks pregnant. This is to help prevent birth defects, such as spina bifida, in your baby.

                  Make sure you speak to your doctor if you have a family history of conditions like spina bifida (known as neural tube defects) as you may need to take a higher dose of 5mg of folic acid each day until you're 12 weeks pregnant.

                  Read about vitamins and minerals during pregnancy for more advice about this.
                </p>
                <h4>
                  What happens if I take too much folic acid?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Taking doses of folic acid higher than 1mg can cover up the symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency, which can eventually damage the nervous system if it's not spotted and treated.

                  This is particularly a concern for older people because it becomes more difficult to absorb vitamin B12 as you get older.
                </p>

                  What does the Department of Health advise?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  The Department of Health recommends that folic acid supplements are taken by women who are pregnant or trying for a baby.

                  Women who aren't pregnant or planning for a baby should be able to get all the folate they need by eating a varied and balanced diet.

                  If you're taking folic acid supplements, it's important not to take too much, as this could be harmful.

                  Taking 1mg or less a day of folic acid supplements is unlikely to cause any harm.

                  Some women have an increased risk of having a pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect, and are advised to take a higher dose of 5mg of folic acid each day until they're 12 weeks pregnant.

                  This is important and unlikely to cause harm, as it's taken on a short-term basis, but speak to your doctor first.

                      liver and liver products such as liver pâté – this is a particularly rich source of vitamin A, so you may be at risk of having too much vitamin A if you have it more than once a week (this is particularly important if you're pregnant)
                      You can get vitamin A by including good sources of beta-carotene in your diet, as the body can change this into vitamin A.

                      The main food sources of beta-carotene are:

                      yellow, red and green (leafy) vegetables, such as spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes and red peppers
                      yellow fruit, such as mango, papaya and apricots

                    <p>
                      The amount of vitamin A adults (19-64 years) need is:

                      0.7mg a day for men
                      0.6mg a day for women
                      You should be able to get all the vitamin A you need from your diet.

                      Any vitamin A your body doesn't need immediately is stored for future use. This means you don't need it every day.
                    </p>

                      What happens if I take too much vitamin A?

                    <p>
                  According to some research, having more than an average of 1.5mg a day of vitamin A over many years may affect your bones, making them more likely to fracture when you're older.

                  This is particularly important for older people, especially women, who are already at risk of osteoporosis, a condition that weakens bones.

                  If you eat liver or liver pâté more than once a week, you may be getting too much vitamin A.

                  Many multivitamins contain vitamin A. Other supplements, such as fish liver oil, are also high in vitamin A.

                  If you take supplements containing vitamin A, make sure your daily intake from food and supplements doesn't exceed 1.5mg. If you eat liver every week, don't take supplements that contain vitamin A.

                  If you're pregnant
                  Having large amounts of vitamin A can harm your unborn baby. So if you're pregnant or thinking about having a baby, don't eat liver or liver products, such as pâté, because these are very high in vitamin A.

                  Also avoid taking supplements that contain vitamin A. Speak to your GP or midwife if you would like more information.
                </p>

                  What does the Department of Health advise?

                <p>
                  You should be able to get all the vitamin A you need by eating a varied and balanced diet. If you take a supplement that contains vitamin A, don't take too much because this could be harmful.

                  Liver is a very rich source of vitamin A. Don't eat liver or liver products, such as pâté, more than once a week. You should also be aware of how much vitamin A there is in any supplements you take.

                  If you're pregnant or thinking of having a baby:

                  avoid taking supplements containing vitamin A, including fish liver oil, unless advised to by your GP
                  avoid liver or liver products, such as pâté, as these are very high in vitamin A
                  Women who've been through the menopause and older men, who are more at risk of osteoporosis, should avoid having more than 1.5mg of vitamin A a day from food and supplements.

                  This means:

                  not eating liver or liver products, such as pâté, more than once a week, or having smaller portions of these
                  taking no more than 1.5mg of vitamin A a day in supplements (including fish liver oil) if you don't eat liver or liver products
                  not taking any supplements containing vitamin A (including fish liver oil) if you eat liver once a week
                  Having an average of 1.5mg a day or less of vitamin A from diet and supplements combined is unlikely to cause any harm.

                <p>
                Choline is responsible for shuttling fat out of the liver, aiding the gallbladder, healthy cell membranes to protect against inflammation, lowering anxiety, preventing damage from glutamate spikes and healthy DNA. Choline deficiency also increases sensitivity to carcinogenic chemicals.

                A common genetic polymorphism (rs12325817) in the PEMT gene can increase this risk due to higher dietary choline requirements. Eighty percent of the women who were homozygous for the SNP manifested signs of choline depletion (liver or muscle dysfunction), relative to 43% of subjects carrying one copy of the variant allele and 13% of subjects without the SNP. Almost 75% of the North Carolina population in the United States has one variant allele.

                Anxiety, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Pregnancy
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Research shows that nine out of 10 People don’t get enough choline. Choline is required for acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter of the vagus nerve that enervates multiple organs including the lungs, heart, liver, stomach and temporal lobe of the brain. A deficiency could affect all of these.

                  One study found that women with higher choline intake have the lowest anxiety. How high is anxiety today? Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Syndrome occurs from a choline deficiency. As of 2015, 25% of people have fatty liver. Of these, 15% are in non-obese patients, 65% in obese patients, and 85% in extremely obese patients. According to Dr. Ronald W. Busuttil, chief of the division of liver transplantation at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, if the prevalence of fatty liver continues into NASH, 25 million Americans will have the disease by 2025, and five million will need new livers.1 Doctors won’t know what to do for you with fatty liver, because there isn’t a pill for it. You have to make dietary and lifestyle changes.

                  PEMT gene polymorphisms are common and increase choline needs even further, especially with variants in MTHFR. Pregnant and nursing mothers require the highest amounts of choline, crucial for a baby’s brain development.The recommended range keeps changing and is currently between 425-550mg for a daily intake up to 930mg for pregnant women in their third trimester. Egg yolks and liver have the highest amount, followed by meat, fish and smaller amounts in Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and collard greens.

                  Its the most important molecule you need to stay healthy and prevent disease yet youve probably never heard of it. It’s the secret to prevent aging, cancer, heart disease, dementia and more, and necessary to treat everything from autism to Alzheimer’s disease. There are more than 89,000 medical articles about it — but your doctor doesn’t know how address the epidemic deficiency of this critical life-giving molecule ...

                    What is it? I’m talking about the mother of all antioxidants, the master detoxifier and maestro of the immune system: GLUTATHIONE (pronounced “gloota-thigh-own”).

                    The good news is that your body produces its own glutathione. The bad news is that poor diet, pollution, toxins, medications, stress, trauma, aging, infections and radiation all deplete your glutathione.

                    This leaves you susceptible to unrestrained cell disintegration from oxidative stress, free radicals, infections and cancer. And your liver gets overloaded and damaged, making it unable to do its job of detoxification.

                    In treating chronically ill patients with Functional Medicine for more than 10 years, I have discovered that glutathione deficiency is found in nearly all very ill patients. These include people with chronic fatigue syndrome, heart disease, cancer, chronic infections, autoimmune disease, diabetes, autism, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, arthritis, asthma, kidney problems, liver disease and more.

                    At first I thought that this was just a coincidental finding, but over the years I have come to realize that our ability to produce and maintain a high level of glutathione is critical to recovery from nearly all chronic illness — and to preventing disease and maintaining optimal health and performance. The authors of those 76,000 medical articles on glutathione I mentioned earlier have found the same thing!

                    So in today’s blog I want to explain what glutathione is, why it’s important and give you 9 tips that will help you optimize your glutathione levels, improve your detoxification system and protect help yourself from chronic illness.
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    What is Glutathione?
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    Glutathione is a very simple molecule that is produced naturally all the time in your body. It is a combination of three simple building blocks of protein or amino acids — cysteine, glycine and glutamine.

                    The secret of its power is the sulfur (SH) chemical groups it contains. Sulfur is a sticky, smelly molecule. It acts like fly paper and all the bad things in the body stick onto it, including free radicals and toxins like mercury and other heavy metals.

                    Normally glutathione is recycled in the body — except when the toxic load becomes too great. And that explains why we are in such trouble ...

                    In my practice, I test the genes involved in glutathione metabolism. These are the genes involved in producing enzymes that allow the body to create and recycle glutathione in the body. These genes have many names, such as GSTM1, GSTP1 and more.

                    These genes impaired in some people for a variety of important reasons. We humans evolved in a time before the 80,000 toxic industrial chemicals found in our environment today were introduced into our world, before electromagnetic radiation was everywhere and before we polluted our skies, lakes, rivers, oceans and teeth with mercury and lead.

                    That is why most people survived with the basic version of the genetic detoxification software encoded in our DNA, which is mediocre at ridding the body of toxins. At the time humans evolved we just didn’t need more. Who knew we would be poisoning ourselves and eating a processed, nutrient-depleted diet thousands of years later?

                    Because most of us didn’t require additional detoxification software, almost of half of the population now has a limited capacity to get rid of toxins. These people are missing GSTM1 function — one of the most important genes needed in the process of creating and recycling glutathione in the body.

                    Nearly all my very sick patients are missing this function. The one-third of our population that suffers from chronic disease is missing this essential gene. That includes me. Twenty years ago I became mercury poisoned and suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome due to this very problem. My GSTM1 function was inadequate and I didn’t produce enough glutathione as a result. Eventually, my body broke down and I became extremely ill ...

                    This is the same problem I see in so many of my patients. They are missing this critical gene and they descend into disease as a result. Let me explain how this happens ...
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    The Importance of Glutathione in Protecting Against Chronic Illness
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    Glutathione is critical for one simple reason: It recycles antioxidants. You see, dealing with free radicals is like handing off a hot potato. They get passed around from vitamin C to vitamin E to lipoic acid and then finally to glutathione which cools off the free radicals and recycles other antioxidants. After this happens, the body can “reduce” or regenerate another protective glutathione molecule and we are back in business.

                    However, problems occur when we are overwhelmed with too much oxidative stress or too many toxins. Then the glutathione becomes depleted and we can no longer protect ourselves against free radicals, infections, or cancer and we can’t get rid of toxins. This leads to further sickness and soon we are in the downward spiral of chronic illness.

                    But that’s not all. Glutathione is also critical in helping your immune system do its job of fighting infections and preventing cancer. That’s why studies show that it can help in the treatment of AIDS.(i)

                    Glutathione is also the most critical and integral part of your detoxification system. All the toxins stick onto glutathione, which then carries them into the bile and the stool — and out of your body.

                    And lastly, it also helps us reach peak mental and physical function. Research has shown that raised glutathione levels decrease muscle damage, reduce recovery time, increase strength and endurance and shift metabolism from fat production to muscle development.

                    If you are sick or old or are just not in peak shape, you likely have glutathione deficiency.
                    In fact, the top British medical journal, the Lancet, found the highest glutathione levels in healthy young people, lower levels in healthy elderly, lower still in sick elderly and the lowest of all in the hospitalized elderly. (ii)

                    Keeping yourself healthy, boosting your performance, preventing disease and aging well depends on keeping your glutathione levels high. I’ll say it again ... Glutathione is so important because it is responsible for keeping so many of the keys to UltraWellness optimized.

                    It is critical for immune function and controlling inflammation. It is the master detoxifier and the body’s main antioxidant, protecting our cells and making our energy metabolism run well.

                    And the good news is that you can do many things to increase this natural and critical molecule in your body. You can eat glutathione-boosting foods. You can exercise. And you can take glutathione-boosting supplements. Let’s review more specifics about each.

                    <li>
                    1. Consume sulfur-rich foods. The main ones in the diet are garlic, onions and the cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, kale, collards, cabbage, cauliflower, watercress, etc.).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    2. Try bioactive whey protein. This is great source of cysteine and the amino acid building blocks for glutathione synthesis. As you know, I am not a big fan of dairy. But this is an exception — with a few warnings. The whey protein MUST be bioactive and made from non-denatured proteins (“denaturing” refers to the breakdown of the normal protein structure). Choose non-pasteurized and non-industrially produced milk that contains no pesticides, hormones, or antibiotics. Immunocal is a prescription bioactive non-denatured whey protein that is even listed in the Physician’s Desk Reference.
                  </li>

                    Exercise for Your Way to More Glutathione
                  </h6>
                  <li>
                    3. Exercise boosts your glutathione levels and thereby helps boost your immune system, improve detoxification and enhance your body’s own antioxidant defenses. Start slow and build up to 30 minutes a day of vigorous aerobic exercise like walking or jogging, or play various sports. Strength training for 20 minutes 3 times a week is also helpful.
                  </li>
                  <h6>
                    Take Glutathione Supporting Supplements
                  </h6>
                  <p>
                    One would think it would be easy just to take glutathione as a pill, but the body digests protein — so you wouldn’t get the benefits if you did it this way. However, the production and recycling of glutathione in the body requires many different nutrients and you CAN take these. Here are the main supplements that need to be taken consistently to boost glutathione. Besides taking a multivitamin and fish oil, supporting my glutathione levels with these supplements is the most important thing I do every day for my personal health.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    4. N-acetyl-cysteine. This has been used for years to help treat asthma and lung disease and to treat people with life-threatening liver failure from Tylenol overdose. In fact, I first learned about it in medical school while working in the emergency room. It is even given to prevent kidney damage from dyes used during x-ray studies.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    5. Alpha lipoic acid. This is a close second to glutathione in importance in our cells and is involved in energy production, blood sugar control, brain health and detoxification. The body usually makes it, but given all the stresses we are under, we often become depleted.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      6. Methylation nutrients (folate and vitamins B6 and B12). These are perhaps the most critical to keep the body producing glutathione. Methylation and the production and recycling of glutathione are the two most important biochemical functions in your body. Take folate (especially in the active form of 5 methyltetrahydrofolate), B6 (in active form of P5P) and B12 (in the active form of methylcobalamin).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    7. Selenium. This important mineral helps the body recycle and produce more glutathione.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    8. A family of antioxidants including vitamins C and E (in the form of mixed tocopherols), work together to recycle glutathione.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    9. Milk thistle (silymarin) has long been used in liver disease and helps boost glutathione levels.
                  </li>

                  From a chemical standpoint, monounsaturated fats are simply fat molecules that have one unsaturated carbon bond in the molecule, this is also called a double bond. Oils that contain monounsaturated fats are typically liquid at room temperature but start to turn solid when chilled. Olive oil is an example of a type of oil that contains monounsaturated fats.

                <p>
                  Monounsaturated fats can help reduce bad cholesterol levels in your blood which can lower your risk of heart disease and stroke. They also provide nutrients to help develop and maintain your body’s cells. Oils rich in monounsaturated fats also contribute vitamin E to the diet, an antioxidant vitamin most Americans need more of.

                <h4>
                  Are monounsaturated fats better for me than saturated fats or trans fats?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Yes. While, all fats provide 9 calories per gram, monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats can have a positive effect on your health, when eaten in moderation. The bad fats –saturated fats and trans fats – can negatively affect your health.

                  Which foods contain monounsaturated fats?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Most foods contain a combination of different fats.

                  Examples of foods high in monounsaturated fats include plant-based liquid oils such as:

                  What if there was a substance that you were consuming regularly that was severely hampering your efforts to get healthy? What if this substance was linked to accelerated aging and a variety of common health problems? What if this substance was used in numerous "health" foods and in numerous restaurants? What if you were taking supplements that contained high amounts of a harmful substance that you were told was healthy? Well, this is happening and you are most likely unaware of it, the most damaging thing you can put in your body is not sugar and it is not gluten, it's PUFAs. Here, I break down the ins and outs of the oils to consume and not consume and why.
                </p>
                <h4>
                  What are PUFAs?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  PUFAs—short for polyunsaturated fats are a type of fatty acid. The type of fat that is available to us via the foods we eat generally fall into two categories: unsaturated fat and saturated fat. For ages we were advised to avoid saturated fats and emphasize unsaturated fats (or avoid fat all together). Many cooking oils actually said "heart-healthy" on the bottle. The research is overwhelmingly clear that saturated fats are not only healthy, but that they are extremely beneficial for overall health. What is not often talked about is the downright damaging impact of the class of highly unsaturated fats known as PUFAs.
                </p>
                <h4>
                  Why should you avoid them?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  The primary issue with PUFAs is that they are highly unstable. All fats have a temperature with which they oxidize (i.e. become unstable, go rancid, become toxic). For PUFAs that temperature is very low. An easy way to remember this is that UNsaturated fats are UNstable and Saturated fats are Stable. Unstable fats are prone to oxidation. Oxidation lead to free radicals. Free radicals lead to cellular damage in your body that can manifest both internally in the form of damaged organs/glands and externally in the form of rapidly aging skin. In addition, many of these fats can become unstable before they even enter your body. During processing, many of these "seed" oils are exposed to high heat (imagine trying to extract oil from a grape seed), which can often make the oils go rancid. In addition, these oils may be exposed to high heat during travel which can also lead to a damaged and unstable product. This is one of the reasons many of these oils are shipped in dark containers and are required to be refrigerated.
                </p>
                <h4>
                  The Benefits of Following low PUFA Diet:
                </h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                  Blood Sugar - PUFAs can damage the cells in your pancreas that produce insulin. If you want to lose body fat and achieve a high level of health, you want a very effective blood sugar handling system. PUFAs can damage this system. For those with blood sugar handling issues the primary focus is usually reduced sugar intake, however, I believe it makes more sense to reduce PUFAs from your diet.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Skin health - PUFAs are closely linked to age pigment formation. In addition, a high level of PUFA in your body means when you are exposed to the sun, free radical damage is more likely.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Metabolism - PUFAs can stress various systems in your body, particularly the rate at which your cells produce energy (i.e. your metabolism). This has numerous implications for thyroid health and general hormonal balance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Digestion / Immune System - PUFAs can impair protein digestion. Digestion problems are rampant in this day and age, eliminating PUFAs are an often overlooked and very effective way at supporting digestion. Your immune system is closely linked to your digestive system, a problem with digestion almost guarantees a poorly functioning immune system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Detoxification - The liver plays a major role in detoxification, PUFAs can overburden the liver. That sluggish feeling you feel after eating out? You may have just consumed PUFAs.
                </li>
                <h4>
                  Where are PUFAs present?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  PUFAs are present in nearly all foods (even vegetables). While some extremists would say to avoid high-PUFA vegetables I don't believe you need to go that far. Small amounts of unprocessed PUFA in a well balanced diet are unlikely to cause any issues. The most damaging PUFAs are the processed liquid cooking oils below:

                <p>
                  From a chemical standpoint, saturated fats are simply fat molecules that have no double bonds between carbon molecules because they are saturated with hydrogen molecules. Saturated fats are typically solid at room temperature.

                  What foods contain saturated fat?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Saturated fats occur naturally in many foods. The majority come mainly from animal sources, including meat and dairy products.

                  Examples of foods with saturated fat are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>

                  pork
                </li>
                <li>
                  poultry with skin
                </li>
                <li>
                  beef fat (tallow)
                </li>
                <li>
                  lard and cream
                </li>
                <li>
                  butter
                </li>
                <li>
                  cheese
                </li>
                <li>
                  other dairy products made from whole or reduced-fat (2 percent) milk
                </li>
                <p>
                  In addition, many baked goods and fried foods can contain high levels of saturated fats. Some plant-based oils, such as palm oil, palm kernel oil and coconut oil, also contain primarily saturated fats, but do not contain cholesterol.

                <h4>
                  What's my daily limit for foods with saturated fats?
                </h4>
                  <p>
                  AHA Recommendation

                  The American Heart Association recommends aiming for a dietary pattern that achieves 5% to 6% of calories from saturated fat.

                  For example, if you need about 2,000 calories a day, no more than 120 of them should come from saturated fat.

                  That’s about 13 grams of saturated fat per day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What are alternatives to replace saturated fats in the foods I eat?
                  To get the nutrients you need, eat a dietary pattern that emphasizes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                  fruits
                </li><li> vegetables</li><li>
                  whole grains</li><li>
                  low-fat dairy products</li><li>
                  poultry</li><li>
                     fish and nuts</li><li>
                  Choose lean meats and poultry without skin and prepare them without added saturated and trans fat</li><li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                  You should replace foods high in saturated fats with foods high in monounsaturated and/or polyunsaturated fats. This means eating foods made with liquid vegetable oil but not tropical oils. It also means eating fish and nuts. You also might try to replace some of the meat you eat with beans or legumes.

                  Genes are one of many risk factors for dementia. While a quarter of Alzheimer's patients have a strong family history of the disease, only 1% directly inherit a gene mutation that causes early-onset Alzheimer's, also known as familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) [1]. But another gene called APOE can influence your risk for the more common late-onset type of Alzheimer's.

                  There are three types of the APOE gene, called alleles: APOE2, E3 and E4. Everyone has two copies of the gene and the combination determines your APOE "genotype"—E2/E2, E2/E3, E2/E4, E3/E3, E3/E4, or E4/E4. The E2 allele is the rarest form of APOE and carrying even one copy appears to reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's by up to 40%. APOE3 is the most common allele and doesn't seem to influence risk. The APOE4 allele, present in approximately 10-15% of people, increases the risk for Alzheimer's and lowers the age of onset. Having one copy of E4 (E3/E4) can increase your risk by 2 to 3 times while two copies (E4/E4) can increase the risk by 12 times [2].

                  Despite this association, the National Institutes of Health only recommends genetic testing for APOE status to advance drug research in clinical trials. APOE4 is just one of many risk factors for dementia and its influence can vary across age, gender, race, and nationality [3][4]. For example, having one copy of the E4 allele may pose more risk to women while having two copies seems to affect men and women similarly [5].

                  To learn more about the genetics of Alzheimer's disease and the contribution of the APOE genes, check out the National Institute on Aging's Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Fact Sheet.

                  THE BIOLOGY OF APOE
                </h4>
                <p>
                  The APOE protein plays many important roles, including the transport of cholesterol across different tissues and cells. The proteins made by varying APOE alleles handle this transport function differently.

                  Outside the brain, APOE4 can increase the risk of atherosclerosis (i.e., hardening of the arteries) and stroke [4], which may explain why APOE4 is a risk factor for vascular causes of cognitive impairment and dementia [6][7]. Inside the brain, APOE helps to clear beta-amyloid, a component of plaques. APOE2 appears to perform this function more effectively than APOE4, with APOE3 in the middle. This difference in beta-amyloid transport represents what scientists call "loss-of-function" toxicity. However, researchers suspect that APOE4 proteins may also have toxic "gain-of-function" activities, such as increased response to stress or injury [4].

                  Gain of toxic function and loss of physiological function
                  APOE4 may increase the risk of dementia through toxic gain of function and through the loss of normal healthy function. Figure adapted from [4]

                  Some drugs in development (called "structure correctors") may change the physical structure of the APOE4 protein so that it behaves more like the APOE2 protein [8]. Another approach is gene therapy, which attempts to insert APOE2 genes into the brains of people with APOE4 genes [9]. To learn more about these programs and other APOE-related drug discovery programs supported by the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation, review our research portfolio with a filter for "APOE4."

                  DOES APOE AFFECT HOW THERAPIES WORK?

                  Researchers are exploring whether the APOE genotype influences the effects of drugs and other therapies in development for Alzheimer's disease and general cognitive health. Highlights of the scientific research in which a differential effect is possible follows, with links to reports.

                    <li>
                  Estrogen: Several studies suggest that the side effects of estrogen-containing hormone replacement therapy may be worse in people who carry the APOE4 allele, at least in terms of brain aging and dementia risk. However, the evidence is inconsistent.

                  Hypertension Management: Effective management of mid-life hypertension is likely to reduce the risk of dementia and cognitive decline in most people. Observational studies suggest that APOE4 carriers might be particularly likely to reap the benefits of effective hypertension management. However, the complex relationships between cardiovascular health, APOE status, and cognition are not well understood.
                </li><li>

                  DHA: Although DHA may be part of a healthy diet for APOE4 carriers, evidence from observational studies, clinical trials, and some preclinical research suggests that it is less likely to protect against dementia or cognitive decline in APOE4 carriers. Some researchers are testing the idea that APOE4 carriers simply need higher doses of DHA because it does not reach their brains as effectively [10].
                </li><li>

                  Statins: Evidence is mixed on whether statins have different effects on brain health in people who carry at least one APOE4 allele. Several observational studies found that APOE4 allele status had no effect while another suggested different effects on cognition in patients with at least one APOE4 allele.
                </li><li>

                  Nicotine: Although there is no evidence suggesting different Alzheimer's disease benefits from nicotine between APOE4 carriers and non-carriers, some evidence suggests nicotine may be a stronger acute cognitive enhancer in APOE4 carriers than non-carriers.
                </li><li>

                  Cerebrolysin: One clinical trial comparing the Exelon™ patch with cerebrolysin found no difference in response rates in patients with at least one APOE4 allele but a 3-fold higher response rate in patients without an APOE4 allele.
